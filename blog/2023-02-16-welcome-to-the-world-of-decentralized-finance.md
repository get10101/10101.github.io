Today, there is not a single trading service which does not require you to hand over your keys in the Bitcoin space. Many have tried to improve that by e.g. automatic payouts and thus reducing the time your Bitcoin is out of your control, but the structural risks of custodial services remain. As such we don't think these solutions go far enough in bringing custody back to the trader.

At 10101 we take this issue seriously and understand the importance of maintaining control over your Bitcoin - not your keys not your coins! Our goal is to provide a solution that empowers traders to retain control of their assets, without sacrificing convenience or security.

- **Self-Custody**: 10101 is 100% self-sovereign - if not 10101%! ðŸ˜‰ At no point in time do you have to hand over your money to a third party. You are in control all the time. That means you can forget about the fees you have to pay on other platforms to get your funds in or out.
- **Mobile First**: 10101 achieves self-sovereignty by using what is with you almost 24/7. Your phone. It's the perfect piece of infrastructure to run your trading service on. No need to become a DevOps expert to be able to trade. All you need to do is install an app on your iPhone or Android device.
- **Full Privacy**: 10101 will not ask you for your personal information or any other KYC related identification.

We believe in free and uncensored trading without interference of any central authority and are convinced that Bitcoin is the only blockchain that is able to hold up to that vision.

- **100% Bitcoin**: As such we are 100% committed to Bitcoin. No side chains, no tokens, no central authority. All trades are secured through the Bitcoin blockchain.
- Lightning Fast: With Lightning on top of Bitcoin you are able to trade or transfer your money instantly.
- **No Counterparty Risk**: As your funds are secured in a Lightning channel by discreet log contracts (DLCs) there exists no counterparty risk. As long as you trust the verifiable source code of Bitcoin, Lightning and 10101 you don't have to trust any third party.

While living up to our self-sovereign principles we are still offering fully fledged derivatives trading with all features you would expect from a custodial offering.

- **P2P Order Book**: Trade with a multitude of traders using leveraged limit and market orders. Our order book service will coordinate the trade and connect traders to the best price offerings.

Based on the derivatives trading we also offer a Synthetic USD wallet, which allows you to transfer your bitcoin at a stable USD price.

All this is delivered by the 10101 team, a multicultural set of seasoned engineers [actively contributing to the open source community](https://10101.substack.com/p/our-path-to-bitcoin-and-self-custodial-trading-4c4dedb23309) in the domain of crypto since the very beginning of CoBloX (over 5 years ago). We are committed to delivering verifiable code and are thrilled to see Bitcoin flourishing and growing as the backbone of the financial industry. Our team is dedicated to provide the tools and resources that traders need for truely self-sovereign trading.

So, join us on this exciting journey, and start trading bitcoin without loosing control over your bitcoin.
