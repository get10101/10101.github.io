## Fund your on-chain wallet
![](/032124_user_guide/homescreen1.png)
![](/032124_user_guide/receive.png)
First you need to send sats on your self-custodial on-chain wallet.

From the **home screen**, click on "receive".
On the "receive" screen, you will be able to copy a receiving address to the clipboard, or to scan the QR code to send funds directly from another wallet.

ℹ️ There is a notice at the bottom of this screen that's your first time funding your wallet. **Take good note that the minimum `DLC Channel` size is 250.000 sats**, it might be wise to send at least 275,000 sats to offset a potential high fees environment. 

> But it could be even wiser, if possible, to open the largest channel possible: the larger it is, the greater the potential gain without on-chain footprint, and therefore the lower the on-chain fees.

## Open your first trade
![](/032124_user_guide/homescreen2.png)
![](/032124_user_guide/tradetab1.png
From the **home screen**, click on the **trading tab**.

From here, you can view the BTCUSD price chart.

Currently, you can submit orders on **futures** contracts at **market price** with a maximum leverage of x5.

To open a position, you must click on the **BUY** or **SELL** button, respectively if you wish to LONG (bet on the upside) or SHORT (bet on the downside).

### Set your trade parameters
![](/032124_user_guide/tradeconfig.png)

You picked your side? fine.

You have the option to adjust both the **quantity** of your trade and the **leverage** you wish to employ.
Based on the chosen **quantity** and **leverage**, the **margin** and **liquidation price** are calculated automatically. 

- The quantity refers to the number of contracts you wish to trade, where each contract equals 1 USD. **The minimal quantity is 1 contract as long as your channel is open and funded.**
- Leverage in futures trading allows traders to control larger positions with a smaller amount of capital, amplifying potential profits (as well as losses) by opening larger positions than their initial investment would allow. **Currently, the maximal leverage is x5.**
- The margin refers to the collateral that traders must deposit to initiate a trade.
- The liquidation price is the threshold at which a trade is automatically closed to prevent additional losses beyond the **margin's** coverage. If your **PnL** exceeds your margin
- PnL, or Profits and Losses refers to the potential profit or loss from an open position that has not been closed yet.


### Open your DLC Channel
![](/032124_user_guide/channelconfig.png)
![](/032124_user_guide/confirm.png)

The first time you open a trade, you will need to open your `DLC Channel`.

> A DLC channel can be likened to a Lightning channel. It operates on a
> dual-funded Multisig model, facilitating off-chain transactions that
> move the cursor between each party's off-chain balances. These
> balances can be collaboratively or unilaterally moved back on-chain.
> To learn more, please visit our [blog](https://10101.finance/blog/)

The minimal channel size is 250.000 sats, or needs to cover the margin of your first trade if it exceeds 250.000 sats.
**However, it might be wise, if possible, to open the largest channel as possible: the larger it is, the greater the potential gain without on-chain footprint, and therefore the lower the on-chain fees.**

ℹ️ Pay attention to the channel opening transaction fees, known as `Funding Tx`: if too low, the funding transaction will not be confirmed and you won't be able to close your trades without bumping the fees with a CPFP transaction.

### Monitor your position
![](/032124_user_guide/positions.png)
From the trading tab, you will be able to see your open position details. 
PnL, margin, leverage, **expiry**, quantity, liquidation price, entry price.

You can also click on the share button to **brag the bag**.

### Brag the bag
![](/032124_user_guide/bragthebag.png)
You have the option to share your position's profit and loss (PnL) as well as its details on social networks like X, Nostr, and Telegram. Additionally, you can choose a meme that reflects your current sentiment based on how's your position doing.

### Orders history
![](/032124_user_guide/orders.PNG)
You can explore your past orders on that screen.

## Rollover your position
In an ideal world there would be no expiry, but the operation of DLCs requires an expiration date for the position. It is set to 1 week by default.

We introduced a quick and simple way to renew it, codenamed _rollover weekends_: If you come online between Friday, 15:00 CET and Sunday, 15:00 CET your position extends for another week.
