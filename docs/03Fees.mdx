# 10101's Fee Structure

## Channels
### Channel opening fees:
10101 doesn't charge any fee for opening a **DLC Channel** (or trading channel).
This may change in the future, but rest assured that we will communicate any updates on the subject.

ℹ️ *When opening a channel, you're funding a 2-on-2 multisig. This action involves mining fees on the Bitcoin blockchain.*
> 🎁 Please note that **the implied mining fees are shared at 50% by 10101's coordinator!** 🎁


### Channel closing fees:
10101 doesn't charge any fee for opening a **DLC Channel** (or trading channel).

ℹ️ *When closing a channel, you're broadcasting a transaction from the 2-of-2 multisig to your on-chain wallet. This action involves mining fees on the Bitcoin blockchain, however, a reserve has been set aside for this purpose when the channel was opened.*
>  ⚠️ Depending on the fee environment, the reserve might be large enough to cover the fee requirements. **This transaction could get stuck in the mempool.** It's possible to bump this transaction by performing a CPFP transaction. ⚠️

## Trading
### Order matching fees:
10101 will charge fees to match your position with another.
These fees correspond to 0.3% of the **QUANTITY** (the size of your trade expressed in USD) and are obviously paid in sats at the current exchange rate.

ℹ️ *If you open a $1000 long, the equivalent of $3 in sats will be taken by the coordinator.*

> ⚠️ Closing a position is an implicit reverse order and therefore **involves new order matching fees.**
> 
**You can benefit from fee rebates on this item.**

 ### Rollovers:
10101 doesn't charge any fee for **Rollovers** (Renewing a contract before it expires).
This may change in the future, but rest assured that we will communicate any updates on the subject.

ℹ️ *When rolling over a position, **you're replacing your order with a new one, with an expiry date further in the future.***

### Funding rates:
10101 doesn't apply funding rates at the moment, but this is likely to change in the future. Rest assured that we will communicate any updates on the subject.

### Fee rebates:
Fee rebates will be applied to the **order matching fee** for one month from activation.
